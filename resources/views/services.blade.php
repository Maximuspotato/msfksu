                            <p>You have a column with indication about pricing. Some items have a defined price (already negotiated with the supplier), some would hold only an indicative price (based on a purchase done in past 3 month) and some would have no price (meaning not purchased in past 3 months and no agreement with a supplier)</p>
                            <p>For the items not in the Standard List, we welcome your request and will work on it to provide you feedback about our capacity (specification of the products)</p>

                                Considering the dynamic market in which we are working in, we need you to confirm the ORC as quick as possible. For this reason, we expect to have a validation of the ORC within 2 weeks from the day you receive the ORC

                            <p>We will send you a first reminder after one week. If no feedback after 10 days, we will send you a final reminder informing you that the order will be cancelled in the coming days</p>
                            <p>In case, you are in the final process of validation and need more than 2 weeks, please inform us so we can try our best to maintain the condition mentioned in the ORC. Unfortunately, we canâ€™t guarantee that we will be successful</p>
